# AndroidAnonymityChat
A secure and serverless chat application that uses the TOR network (Deep Web) to send the messages

### Features:
1. _**Security**_ ---> (the communication between contacts is via the [Tor Network](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#thesolution) which is providing a high level of security)
2.  _**Anonymity**_ ---> (as in security case, the [Tor Network](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#thesolution) is providing the anonymity on the Internet)
3.  _**Availability**_ ---> (There is no server involved in offering the communication services. There is NO 'Central Server' or 'Server in the Cloud' to provide any services. The application is functional and available 100% of the time as long as you and your partner are using **Anonymity Chat** and an Internet Connection).
4.  _**Privacy**_ ---> (Message history is kept on each client side as long as they want. The user is the one that is deciding for how long the conversation history is kept. The user is the sole responsible for his conversation privacy.)
5. _**Scalability**_ ---> (Having a **SERVERLESS** software architecture, the application and the communication services are easy to scale)

## The project state is in Pre-Release form, therefore please access the [Development branch] (https://github.com/batsw/AndroidAnonymityChat/tree/development) to find more details
